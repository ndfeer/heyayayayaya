	<p>And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out, whats in my head and I-I-i am feeling... a little peculiar....
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath, and get real high and I, scream from the top of my lungs, WHATS GOING ON?!

And I say.....
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA....I SAID HEY! Whats going on?
And I say
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA....I SAID HEY! Whats going on

And he tries... Oh my gosh do I try! I try all the time, in this institution.....
And he prays! Oh my gosh do I pray! I pray all sanctity...MYEEH... for a revolution!

And I say.....
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA....I SAID HEY! Whats going on?
And I say...

Don't cry outloud! Just keep inside... And learn how to hide, your feelings.....

HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA....I SAID HEY! Whats going on? YEAH!</p>
